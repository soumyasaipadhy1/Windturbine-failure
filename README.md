### 📍Project- Wind Turbine Failure Analysis
#### -Client: Power and Energy Manufacture
#### -Business Problem: 
- Unplanned failure of wind turbine engine is leading to huge losses and electricity generation is negatively impacted.
#### -Business Solution:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing: - The datasets must be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure that they are consistent and complete. This may involve removing outliers, converting data to a common format, and filling in missing values.
- Data analysis: - The data can then be analyzed to identify trends and patterns in wind turbine blade failure.
#### -Technology Stack:
- **Database:** Excel, MySQL
- **BI Tools used:** Microsoft Power Bi and Google Looker Studio
- **Deployment Tools:** Power Bi
#### -Business Benefits:
- Reduce the unplanned failure of wind turbine engine by at least 30%.
- Achieve a cost saving of at least $2M per year due to reduction of unplanned downtime.
